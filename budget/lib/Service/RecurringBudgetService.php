 * The budget view uses these figures as an automatic fallback: a (sub-)category
 * with no manually-set budget shows its committed recurring total as the limit,
 * so the "fixed" part of a budget is derived from the recurring items while the
 * "variable" part can still be typed in manually (which always wins).
 *
 * Amounts are normalized to a monthly figure regardless of the item's
 * frequency; the frontend converts that to the category's budget period.
