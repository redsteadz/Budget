## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Password protection feature for enhanced app security
  - Optional password required to access the budget app (secondary protection layer)
  - User-configurable password (minimum 6 characters) set via Settings > Security
  - Session management with configurable timeout (15/30/60 minutes of inactivity)
  - Auto-lock after inactivity period with activity monitoring on user interactions
  - Manual lock button in navigation when password protection is enabled
  - Failed attempt tracking: 5 failed attempts triggers 5-minute account lockout
  - Session tokens (64-character random tokens) stored securely in localStorage
  - Password hashing using bcrypt via PHP's `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`
  - Change password and disable protection options (requires current password verification)
  - Rate limiting on auth endpoints (5-10 requests per minute depending on endpoint)
  - Modal UI for password entry with error handling and validation
  - New database table `budget_auth` for password and session management
  - RESTful API endpoints: `/api/auth/status`, `/api/auth/setup`, `/api/auth/verify`, `/api/auth/lock`, `/api/auth/extend`, `/api/auth/disable`, `/api/auth/password`
- Factory reset feature to restore app to empty state
  - Deletes ALL user data (accounts, transactions, bills, categories, settings, pension data, shared expenses, etc.)
  - Preserves audit logs for compliance purposes
  - Danger Zone section in settings page with prominent warnings
  - Requires typing "DELETE" (case-sensitive) to confirm
  - Password confirmation required via Nextcloud's built-in security
  - Rate limited to 3 attempts per 5 minutes to prevent abuse
  - Database transaction ensures all-or-nothing deletion (rollback on error)
  - Gracefully handles missing database tables for features not yet used
  - Audit trail logged with counts of deleted items per entity type

### Fixed
- Password protection setup failing with "Entity which should be updated has no id" error
- Auth entity `id` property access level changed from protected to public (required by Nextcloud Entity framework)
- Database migration added to recreate `budget_auth` table with auto-increment `id` as primary key
- `user_id` changed from primary key to unique index for proper ORM compatibility
- CSV import failing with "Date is required" error on all rows
- Column mapping dropdowns sending array indices (0, 1, 2) instead of column names ("Date", "Amount", "Description") to backend
- Auto-detection of CSV columns not working after upload
- TransactionNormalizer now skips non-column mapping fields (boolean config flags) to prevent lookup errors

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-21

## [1.0.33] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- Duplicate transaction detection completely broken during statement imports (GitHub issue #6)
- OFX FITID (bank transaction ID) was lost during transaction mapping, preventing bank-provided duplicate detection
- Import IDs used random file identifiers instead of content hashing, causing same transaction to generate different IDs
- Preview methods didn't generate import IDs before duplicate checking, so duplicates were never detected in preview
- Import preview showed no indication of which transactions were duplicates
- "Show duplicates" and "Show uncategorized" checkboxes had no effect on preview display
- Wrong checkbox ID used in JavaScript ('skip-duplicates' vs 'show-duplicates')
- Error status badges and balance amounts too dark to read (GitHub issue #8)
- Installation failure on PostgreSQL: "Column is type Bool and also NotNull, so it can not store false" (GitHub issue #5)
- Migration Version001000017 used `notnull => true` for boolean columns, violating Nextcloud's cross-database compatibility requirements
- Boolean columns `is_settled` and `apply_on_import` now correctly defined as nullable per Nextcloud standards

### Changed
- TransactionNormalizer now preserves OFX transaction 'id' field for duplicate detection
- Import ID generation changed from `fileId_index_hash` to content-based: `ofx_fitid_{id}` for OFX or `hash_{md5(date+amount+description+reference)}` for CSV/QIF
- Same transaction imported multiple times now generates same import ID, enabling proper duplicate detection
- Import preview now includes 'isDuplicate' flag on each transaction
- Duplicate transactions displayed with red "Duplicate" badge, new transactions with green "New" badge
- Duplicate transactions unchecked by default in preview to prevent accidental import
- "Show duplicates" and "Show uncategorized" checkboxes now filter preview table in real-time
- Preview counter updates to reflect filtered results
- Error status badges and balance amounts now use brighter colors for improved readability

## [1.0.32] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- Background job ArgumentCountError flooding logs: "Too few arguments to function BillReminderJob::__construct()"
- All background jobs (BillReminderJob, CleanupImportFilesJob, NetWorthSnapshotJob, CleanupAuditLogsJob) now use lazy dependency injection via Server::get()
- Removed manual background job service registrations that weren't used by Nextcloud's cron system

### Added
- SettingService to properly wrap SettingMapper following architectural patterns
- Convenient methods for user settings: get(), set(), getAll(), delete(), exists()

## [1.0.31] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- Account balances showing scientific notation (e.g., `9.9920072216264e-15`) due to floating-point precision errors
- Balance calculations now use BCMath for precise decimal arithmetic via MoneyCalculator
- TransactionService, NetWorthService, and DebtPayoffService now prevent precision loss during calculations

### Changed
- AccountMapper.updateBalance() now accepts both float and string parameters for better precision handling
- All balance arithmetic operations now use string-based BCMath calculations internally

## [1.0.30] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- Account numbers displaying as extremely long strings of asterisks when decryption fails
- Added error handling for encryption/decryption failures with proper logging
