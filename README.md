## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Add Accounts** - Navigate to the Accounts section and add your bank accounts
2. **Import Transactions** - Use the Import feature to upload your bank statements
3. **Set Up Categories** - Create categories that match your spending patterns
4. **Configure Import Rules** - Set up rules to automatically categorize future imports
5. **Track Bills** - Add recurring bills to monitor upcoming payments
6. **Set Goals** - Create savings goals to track progress toward financial targets

### Importing Bank Statements

The app supports the following formats:
- **CSV** - Most banks provide CSV exports (supports European formats)
- **OFX** - Open Financial Exchange format
- **QIF** - Quicken Interchange Format

#### CSV Import Tips

1. The first row should contain column headers
2. Common columns: Date, Description, Amount, Balance
3. Use the column mapping feature to match your bank's format
4. For European banks with separate income/expense columns, use dual-column amount mapping
5. The app auto-detects delimiters (comma, semicolon, tab)

### Setting Up Import Rules

The advanced rules engine uses a visual query builder for complex patterns:

1. Go to **Rules** in the navigation menu
2. Click **Add Rule**
3. Build criteria using the visual query builder:
   - Add conditions (field, match type, pattern)
   - Group conditions with AND/OR operators
   - Use NOT operator for negation
   - Create nested groups for complex logic
4. Configure actions (category, vendor, notes, etc.)
5. Set priority and behavior (always, if_empty, append, merge)
6. **Preview** to test matches before saving
7. **Run Now** to apply to existing transactions

### Bills and Transfers

**Bills:**
- Add recurring bills with custom frequency patterns
- Enable auto-pay to automatically mark bills as paid on due date
- Create future transactions for cash flow planning
- View annual bills calendar to see when bills are due throughout the year

**Transfers:**
- Track recurring transfers between accounts (e.g., monthly savings transfers)
- Enable auto-pay for automatic execution
- Set transaction description patterns for import matching

### Forecasting

The forecast feature analyzes historical spending to predict future balances:

1. Select the account(s) to forecast
2. Choose the historical period to analyze (3, 6, or 12 months)
3. Select the forecast horizon
4. Generate the forecast

The forecast considers:
- Regular income patterns
- Recurring expenses
- Seasonal variations
- Average spending by category

### Data Migration

To move your data between Nextcloud instances:

1. **Export** - Go to Settings > Data Migration > Export to download all your data
2. **Import** - On the new instance, go to Settings > Data Migration > Import and upload the export file

## API

The app provides a REST API for all functionality:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/accounts` | Account management |
| `/api/transactions` | Transaction CRUD and search |
| `/api/categories` | Category hierarchy |
| `/api/tag-sets` | Tag set management |
| `/api/import` | Bank statement import |
| `/api/import-rules` | Advanced auto-categorization rules |
| `/api/forecast` | Balance predictions |
| `/api/bills` | Recurring bill tracking with auto-pay |
| `/api/transfers` | Recurring transfers between accounts |
| `/api/goals` | Savings goal management |
| `/api/pensions` | Pension account tracking |
| `/api/reports` | Financial reports |
| `/api/migration` | Data export/import |
| `/api/auth` | Password protection |

## Troubleshooting

### Import fails with "Invalid format"

- Ensure your CSV has headers in the first row
- Check that date format matches your locale settings
- Verify the file encoding is UTF-8
- For European formats, the app will auto-detect delimiters and number formats

### Transactions not categorizing automatically

- Check that import rules are active
- Use the **Preview** feature to test rule matching before saving
- Verify rule patterns match transaction descriptions
- Review rule priority order (higher priority rules execute first)

### Forecast seems inaccurate

- Ensure you have at least 3 months of transaction history
- Check for unusual one-time transactions that might skew averages
- Verify all regular transactions are properly categorized

### Categories page is blank

- Verify categories were imported successfully via Settings > Data Migration
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try refreshing browser cache (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
