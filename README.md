## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Add Accounts** - Navigate to the Accounts section and add your bank accounts
2. **Import Transactions** - Use the Import feature to upload your bank statements
3. **Set Up Categories** - Create categories that match your spending patterns
4. **Configure Import Rules** - Set up rules to automatically categorize future imports
5. **Track Bills** - Add recurring bills to monitor upcoming payments
6. **Set Goals** - Create savings goals to track progress toward financial targets

### Importing Bank Statements

The app supports the following formats:
- **CSV** - Most banks provide CSV exports
- **OFX** - Open Financial Exchange format
- **QIF** - Quicken Interchange Format

#### CSV Import Tips

1. The first row should contain column headers
2. Common columns: Date, Description, Amount, Balance
3. Use the column mapping feature to match your bank's format

### Setting Up Import Rules

Import rules automatically categorize transactions based on patterns:

1. Go to Settings > Import Rules
2. Click "Add Rule"
3. Configure:
   - **Pattern** - Text to match (e.g., "GROCERY STORE")
   - **Field** - Which field to match against (description, vendor)
   - **Match Type** - Contains, starts with, ends with, or regex
   - **Category** - Category to assign when matched
   - **Priority** - Higher priority rules are applied first

### Forecasting

The forecast feature analyzes historical spending to predict future balances:

1. Select the account(s) to forecast
2. Choose the historical period to analyze (3, 6, or 12 months)
3. Select the forecast horizon
4. Generate the forecast

The forecast considers:
- Regular income patterns
- Recurring expenses
- Seasonal variations
- Average spending by category

### Data Migration

To move your data between Nextcloud instances:

1. **Export** - Go to Settings > Data Migration > Export to download all your data
2. **Import** - On the new instance, go to Settings > Data Migration > Import and upload the export file

## API

The app provides a REST API for all functionality:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/accounts` | Account management |
| `/api/transactions` | Transaction CRUD and search |
| `/api/categories` | Category hierarchy |
| `/api/import` | Bank statement import |
| `/api/import-rules` | Auto-categorization rules |
| `/api/forecast` | Balance predictions |
| `/api/bills` | Recurring bill tracking |
| `/api/goals` | Savings goal management |
| `/api/reports` | Financial reports |
| `/api/migration` | Data export/import |

## Troubleshooting

### Import fails with "Invalid format"

- Ensure your CSV has headers in the first row
- Check that date format matches your locale settings
- Verify the file encoding is UTF-8

### Transactions not categorizing automatically

- Check that import rules are active
- Verify rule patterns match transaction descriptions
- Review rule priority order

### Forecast seems inaccurate

- Ensure you have at least 3 months of transaction history
- Check for unusual one-time transactions that might skew averages
- Verify all regular transactions are properly categorized
