# Accounts

> Accounts represent your real-world bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and other financial accounts. Each account holds its own set of transactions and tracks its balance independently, giving you a complete picture of your finances across all institutions.

## Account Types

When creating an account, you select a type that determines how the app interprets balances and which optional fields are shown.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Checking** | Standard current/checking accounts used for everyday spending and income. Balance is expected to be positive. |
| **Savings** | Savings or deposit accounts. Treated the same as checking but visually distinguished on the dashboard. |
| **Credit Card** | Revolving credit accounts. Balances are displayed as amounts owed. Supports credit limit tracking and utilization warnings (alerts at 70% and 90% utilization). |
| **Investment** | Brokerage, retirement, or other investment accounts for tracking portfolio value. |
| **Cash** | Physical cash or petty cash tracking. Useful when you want to record cash spending without tying it to a bank. |
| **Loan** | Mortgages, personal loans, auto loans, or other debts. Balances represent the amount owed. Supports interest rate and minimum payment fields for debt payoff planning. |
| **Cryptocurrency** | Wallets or exchange accounts for digital currencies. Supports a wallet address field and works with crypto currencies (BTC, ETH, etc.). |

> **Tip:** The account type mainly affects how balances are displayed and which optional fields appear on the account form. You can always change the type later by editing the account.

## Creating an Account

Navigate to **Accounts > Add Account** to create a new account.

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | A descriptive name for the account (e.g., "Chase Checking", "Amex Gold"). |
| **Type** | One of the seven account types listed above. |
| **Currency** | The currency this account operates in. The app supports 45+ currencies including major fiat currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF, etc.) and cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, etc.). |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Opening Balance** | The starting balance when you begin tracking this account. For credit cards and loans, enter the amount owed as a positive number. |
| **Credit Limit** | Available for credit card accounts. Used to calculate credit utilization percentage. |
| **Interest Rate** | Available for loan and credit card accounts. Used in debt payoff calculations. |
| **Minimum Payment** | Available for loan and credit card accounts. Used in debt payoff planning. |
| **Overdraft Limit** | The overdraft threshold for the account. The app warns you when your balance drops below this limit. |

> **Note:** The currency is set per account, so you can track accounts in different currencies. Multi-currency totals on the dashboard use exchange rates to convert to your default currency. See [Exchange Rates](exchange-rates.md) for details.

## Account Detail View

Click any account card to open the account detail view, which shows:

### Current Balance vs. Projected Balance

- **Current Balance** is the sum of all cleared (non-scheduled) transactions plus the opening balance. This reflects what your actual bank balance should be.
- **Projected Balance** includes scheduled (future-dated) transactions in addition to cleared ones. This tells you what your balance will be once upcoming transactions clear.

The projected balance is shown alongside the current balance when they differ, giving you visibility into expected future cash flow.

### Balance History Chart

The detail view includes a balance history chart that plots your account balance over time. This helps you spot trends, identify spending patterns, and see how your balance has changed historically.

### Recent Transactions

The detail view shows the most recent transactions for the account with quick access to add new transactions or navigate to the full [Transactions](transactions.md) view filtered to this account.

## Account Information

Each account has optional banking detail fields for your reference. These fields are all encrypted at rest and are never shared or transmitted.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Account Number** | Your bank account number. |
| **Routing Number** | US bank routing/ABA number. Shown for checking and savings accounts. |
| **Sort Code** | UK bank sort code. Shown based on account type and currency context. |
| **IBAN** | International Bank Account Number. Common for European and international accounts. |
| **SWIFT/BIC** | SWIFT or BIC code for international wire transfers. |
| **Wallet Address** | Cryptocurrency wallet address. Shown only for cryptocurrency accounts. |

> **Tip:** These fields are purely for your own reference -- the app does not connect to any bank. They are stored with encryption so you can keep all your account details in one place without security concerns.

The account form dynamically shows and hides these fields based on the account type you select. For example, selecting **Checking** shows routing number and IBAN fields, while selecting **Cryptocurrency** shows the wallet address field instead.

## Reconciling Accounts

Reconciliation verifies that your tracked balance matches your actual bank statement. This helps catch missing or incorrect transactions.

### How to Reconcile

1. Open the account detail view and click **Reconcile Account**, or navigate to **Transactions** and click the **Reconcile** button.
2. Select the account to reconcile (pre-selected if you started from the account detail view).
3. Enter the **statement balance** from your bank statement and the **statement date**.
4. The reconciliation panel shows the difference between your tracked balance and the statement balance.
5. Review your transactions and mark them as reconciled by checking them off.
6. If there is a remaining difference, the app offers to create an adjustment transaction to bring your balance in line with the statement.

The adjustment transaction is created with the description "Reconciliation Adjustment" and a note recording the target statement balance, so you can identify it later.

> **Tip:** Reconcile regularly -- monthly when you receive your bank statement is a good cadence. This catches data entry errors and missing transactions early.

## Deleting an Account

To delete an account, open the account detail view and choose the delete option.

> **Warning:** Deleting an account permanently removes the account and all of its transactions. This action cannot be undone. If you want to keep historical data, consider archiving the account by renaming it (e.g., "Old Checking - Closed") rather than deleting it.
