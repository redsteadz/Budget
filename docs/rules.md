# Import Rules

> Auto-categorize imported transactions using pattern-based rules with a visual query builder, so you spend less time manually sorting transactions and more time understanding your finances.

## Overview

Import Rules let you define conditions that automatically assign categories, tags, vendors, and other fields to transactions as they are imported. Rules use a visual query builder with boolean logic, support multiple actions per rule, and can be previewed or applied retroactively to existing transactions.

## Creating a Rule

1. Navigate to **Budget > Rules**
2. Click **Add Rule**
3. Give the rule a descriptive name (e.g., "Amazon purchases", "Monthly rent")

## Building Criteria

Each criterion consists of three parts:

| Component | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| **Field** | Description, Vendor, Amount, Date, Reference, Notes |
| **Match type** | Contains, Equals, Starts with, Ends with, Regex, Greater than, Less than |
| **Pattern** | The value to match against |

> **Tip:** Use "Contains" for most text matching. Reserve "Regex" for complex patterns where simpler match types won't suffice.

## Boolean Logic

Combine multiple conditions using logical operators:

- **AND** — all conditions must be true
- **OR** — at least one condition must be true
- **NOT** — negate a condition or group

Groups can be nested to unlimited depth for complex logic. For example:

```
(vendor contains "Amazon" AND amount > 50)
OR
(description contains "Prime")
```

This matches any Amazon purchase over £50, or any transaction mentioning "Prime" regardless of vendor or amount.

## Actions

When a rule matches a transaction, one or more actions are applied:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Set category | Assign a specific category |
| Set vendor | Set the vendor/payee field |
| Set notes | Add or replace notes |
| Add tags | Attach tags from your tag sets |
| Set account | Assign to a specific account |
| Set type | Mark as expense or income |
| Set reference | Set the reference field |

You can configure multiple actions per rule — for example, set the category to "Subscriptions" and add a "streaming" tag simultaneously.

## Priority

Each rule has a priority number. **Higher priority numbers run first.** When multiple rules match the same transaction, the highest-priority rule wins for any conflicting actions.

> **Tip:** Use priority strategically — give specific rules (e.g., "Netflix subscription") a higher priority than general rules (e.g., "All entertainment vendors").

## Behavior Settings

Control how actions interact with existing field values:

| Behavior | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Always** | Overwrite existing value |
| **If empty** | Only set the field if it is currently blank |
| **Append** | Add to the existing value (text fields) |
| **Merge** | Combine with existing values (for tags) |

> **Note:** "If empty" is useful when you want manual categorization to take precedence over rules.

## Preview Matches

Before saving a rule, click **Preview** to see which existing transactions in your account would match the criteria. This lets you verify the rule behaves as expected without making any changes.

> **Tip:** If the preview shows unexpected matches, refine your criteria — add more conditions or switch to a more specific match type.

## Run on Existing Transactions

Rules normally apply during import, but you can also apply them retroactively:

1. Open the rule you want to apply
2. Click **Run Rule Now**
3. Optionally restrict to uncategorized transactions only
4. Confirm to apply

> **Warning:** Running a rule with "Always" behavior on existing transactions will overwrite any manual categorization you've previously done on matching transactions.

## Related Features

- [Import](import.md) — rules are applied automatically during the import process
- [Transactions](transactions.md) — rules modify transaction fields
- [Categories](categories.md) — the most common rule action is setting a category
- Tags — rules can add tags from your configured tag sets

## Settings

- **Auto-apply import rules** — toggle whether rules run automatically on new imports (on/off). When disabled, you must run rules manually.
